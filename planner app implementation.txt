What do I need for this  new planner application ?

1. You need to be able to add a task
2. You need to be able to set a date that you want it to be completed
3. Tasks can be grouped according to days, weeks, months
4. Tasks can be grouped by labels like education, personal,...
4. If tasks are not complete they will be tagged as expired but not deleted
5. Expired tasks can be recycled 
6. A warning time can be set to allow the user to be prompted about the deadline for the task
7. Task should have title, description (optional since the title my be descriptive enough)

Implementation ideas
1. I need a user model (The default django user model will suffice unless I need some additional fields I can't think of now)
   I think it will be best to subclass AbstractUser just for future purposes
2. A user is going to able have many task which is a one-to-many relationship from User to Task
3. 
4.


Frontend Stack
1. I am going to use html, css and javascript
2. I am going to use bootstrap and write some custom css
3. I might use some tailwind also (wish me luck)
